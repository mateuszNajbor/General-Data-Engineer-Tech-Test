# General-Data-Engineer-Tech-Test

Implementation of finding values occurring odd number of times for key.
The implementation contains 2 algorithms: algorithmWithGroupBy and algorithmWithHashMap.

App takes 2 parameters: a path to a folder containing the input files in csv or tsv format and a path to a folder for the output files.

In the file OddValuesAlgorithmTest.scala you can find tests of this implementation.
